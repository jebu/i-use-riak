# inagist.com - your personal news wire

InAGist (in-a-gist) analyzes twitter content in real-time and filters out the most popular and relevant tweets on a per-user bases. Once you log-in to inagist we keep watching you stream picking out tweets which are getting most responses or retweets from people you follow. InAGist picks out personalized trends in real-time from your twitter stream. All this is delivered to you on inagist.com or as notifications via the Chrome extension, XMPP or notify.io. Our aim is to make sure that you are always kept up-to-date on topics which matter to you.

# Our useage of Riak
We use Riak for storing tweets that we receive from the Twitter stream, and RiakSearch for powering our personalized twitter search. We currently run a 3 node cluster and handle about 8mn tweets a day. Initially we started out on Cassandra, but for various reasons moved over to Riak. Primarily resource constraints forced us to move away from Cassandra, read more on our [blog post](http://blog.inagist.com/riak-at-inagistcom) for some reasoning on the move. To summarize we picked Riak for the following reasons

## Straight forward design
Riak key-value store is essentially a layer which takes the data and stores multiple copies of it in predetermined locations based on the key. We decided what storage layer we wanted to use and how many copies we wanted. At query time it would give us the data from the best location. Simple and easy to understand.

## Choice of storage layers
Riak comes bundled with lots of storage engine options and hooking one in is very straight forward. We use innodb and bitcask for our backends. Bitcask is great for those boxes with lots of memory and innodb for the ones where we dont have so much.

## Flexible query model
Link-Map-Reduce query model provides flexibility to the data access options, allowing us to express euqivalents of SQL-like joins in a single query. Again more on our [blog](http://blog.inagist.com/link-map-reduce-in-riak-an-example-from-inagi) on how we use the Link-Map-Reduce.

## Riak Search
While picking Riak, Riak Search was not yet available. We knew that this was in the works and would be available soon enough. We recently integrated this into our backend and have been able to provide features like personalized search with little extra effort on our part. Also digging into the RiakSearch implementation led us to build out our [live search](http://inagist.com/search/live?q=wikileaks) feature which streams data matching search terms to the client as they are being indexed in Riak.

## Erlang 
Our backend being in Erlang, the ability to couple with the data store natively is a big win. And we are big believers in scale-ability and reliabilty that Erlang brings. 

# Quote?
Riak should be on the top of you list when looking out for a reliable key-value store.

You can find more on our usage of Riak on our blog at [blog.inagist.com](http://blog.inagist.com)

# Footnote
We also use [riak_err](https://github.com/basho/riak_err) from Basho on our Erlang nodes.
