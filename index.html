			<p><a href="http://wiki.basho.com">Riak</a> is an awesome database, and we've been hearing more and more from people across the community that are putting Riak into production for this, that, and the other awesome thing. In fact, we've been hearing it so much that we thought we should make it easier for other people to hear about it, too.</p>
			
			<p>This site is a home for Riak users to talk about their applications and use cases <strong>in their own words</strong>. Using the power of GitHub's simple forking along with their super-useful <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Pages feature</a>, you can <a href = "http://github.com/pharkmillups/i-use-riak">fork the repo,</a> throw together a few details on your Riak usage in one of several very simple formats, add your post to the repo, and send a pull request. We'll take care of the rest.</p>	 
				
			<p>If Basho's software is enabling your ops team to sleep better at night or your request latencies to drop by 20% on average, we want you to tell the world about it here. Developers everywhere are standing by right now to hear your tale. The best part is, we want you say whatever you want. If you're feeling inspired, take 20 minutes and write an extensive overview of your app and how fits into it. Whether you're running Riak on one node for a personal TODO app or you have 200 Riak nodes across five data centers, this is the place to share your story.</p> 
			
<p>To <strong>contribute</strong>, check out the <a href="https://github.com/pharkmillups/i-use-riak">contribution guidelines on the repo's README</a>. It'll only take you few moments to contribute, and users everywhere will be thrilled to read about how you're using Riak (or any other Basho software, for that matter).</p>
